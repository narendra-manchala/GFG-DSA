1. We solve a big problem assuming that solution is available for a smaller problem.
    We must handle "base case" explicitly.
2. Tail Recursion - recursive call is the last statement in the function
    Tail call Elimination - compilers optimize by not remembering the code of all function
        executions 
    To implement "Tail Recursion" we may add extra argument to the function to remember the result of previous
    execution
